*DISCLSCLAIMER* this website is not actually a Tate website (in case that isn't glaringly obvious). 
Signing up for things will not actually sign you up and if you actually want information regarding the Tate galleries and collection please visit their actual website.

This is my programming (gold) summative assignment for term 1.

The main html page is 'Summative assignment.html'.
I tried my best to get some data visualisations but could not make it work unfortunately. 
There are commented out sections of code that show me trying to follow an online tutorial but having no luck. Please ignore all these, sorry.
